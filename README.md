jQuery Rotary Datepicker - an AWESOME new take on the calendar

Checkout the [jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/ProLoser/QyNhB/embedded/result,js,html,css/) to see a prototype.

I'll be attaching sketches and notes soon too.

## Upcoming Features

* _REDICULOUSLY FAST_ selections by using the **mouse scroll wheel**
 * Scroll on each radial to just control that radial
 * Scroll on the center to control all radials at once
* Use a **drag interface** and **inertia** on supported devices
* **Timestamps** will be on an outer ring with an **AM/PM button** at the very end
* **Infinite scrolling** for years
* Click the button to confirm and close the picker
* Clicking outside the rotary can (configurable) cancel the picker
* [Esc] key cancels the picker
* Sound FX! (?) To piss off everyone around you.
